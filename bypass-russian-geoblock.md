#### How Microsoft is blocking it?

It's primarily checking Russian IP address and basis on that above error is shown to users. However that's not the end of it. Once it find out that Russian IP is used then installer creates a below registry key to remember it. After that if you even use a VPN then installer will still keep showing the error.

```         
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\ExperimentConfigs\Ecs]
"CountryCode"="std::wstring|RU"
```

### Solution

**1-** Open command prompt as admin and enter,

```         
reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\ExperimentConfigs\Ecs" /v "CountryCode" /t REG_SZ /d "std::wstring|US" /f
```

After that office installer won't show any such errors. You can apply this before or after running the Office installer and you can download Office without any VPN and with your Russian IP address.

**2-** Use [Offline installer file](office_c2r_links.html) to install Office.

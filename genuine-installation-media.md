## How to use .svf files?

As an example, if you want to download a .iso file of a French language version of Office 2010 SP1 Pro Vl, you will need to do the followings.

-   Download a full-size English .iso file

-   Download a small-size French .svf file

-   Put English .iso and French svf file and tool [SVF-extractor](https://www.softpedia.com/get/System/Back-Up-and-Recovery/SVF-eXtractor.shtml) into a folder altogether.

-   Then use the extract option in the tool, and it will generate an original French language full .iso file.

## How to verify genuinity of files?

-   We can use [file hashing method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_verification) to verify if a file is genuine or not.

-   But we must first know the actual checksum of the file.

-   Microsoft does not publish a checksums list on public links for their files, however, it's available to paid subscribers of [MVS](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/subscriptions/).

-   There are many places where we can find the checksums for Microsoft files and compare them with our files with tools like [HashCheck](https://github.com/gurnec/HashCheck/releases). Below is a list of sites containing checksums.

    1.  [files.rg-adguard](https://files.rg-adguard.net/) (most complete collection)
    2.  [genuine-iso-verifier](https://genuine-iso-verifier.weebly.com/)
    3.  [msdn.rg-adguard](https://msdn.rg-adguard.net/)
    4.  [MVS dump](https://awuctl.github.io/mvs/)
    5.  [sha1.rg-adguard](https://sha1.rg-adguard.net/)

-   **Can I activate Office 365?**\
    O365 can not be activated with KMS. To activate it, the script installs Mondo 2016 licenses and activates that. This license is near to O365 feature-wise, you can get offline features of O365 but you can't get server side O365 specific features such as 1TB storage in Onedrive. 5GB storage in free onedrive account would work fine.

-   **Can I get Co-Pilot feature in Office 365 with Mondo License?**\
    At the time of writing, this feature is in testing period and not available to all 365 users. And as stated in above question, all online features are not available in Mondo License, so we can't say if it will work or not.

    Run Online KMS from the latest MAS version.

    The online KMS option works for Windows 7 Pro & Enterprise (Not Ultimate). All Windows 8/8.1 editions are supported by Online KMS option.

-   **Where can I donate?**\
    MAS project doesn't accept donations and it's free.\
    It's because it's a community project and involves many contributors, splitting donations is not practical and also because profiting from piracy is not good.

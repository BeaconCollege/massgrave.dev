-   **Note: HWID Activation is not working, use KMS38 option for now\
    **HWID activation is not working because of server-side changes at Microsoft. Use the KMS38 option for now. Your previously established HWID is safe. This happened because of [recent change](https://devicepartner.microsoft.com/en-us/communications/comm-windows-ends-installation-path-for-free-windows-7-8-upgrade) to not allow Windows 7/8 free upgrades.

# Install Win 10/11 HWID Key

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   You can find this option in MAS extras section.

-   HWID (Digital License) can auto-activate a system even after OS is re-installed.

-   But this auto-activation works only when HWID (Retail/OEM/MAK) key is already installed which happens if you downloaded Windows 10-11 for **free** from the Official Microsoft website.

-   However, Business versions (Windows Enterprise, LTSB/C editions) are not publicly available. These editions have the KMS key installed by default. Due to this HWID can't auto-activate the system.

-   To avoid running the HWID script **again**, you can instead just install the HWID key and the system will auto-activate.

-   This is the scenario where this option is useful.
